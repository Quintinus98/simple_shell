# Simple Shell

The idea behind this project is to implement a Linux shell with basic features.

The project was designed and developed in **C**.

To compile the project, first clone then run.
```sh
	./compile.bash
```
To run the program
```sh
	./hsh
```

The program behaves similarly to ```/bin/sh```.

Some built-in functions are defined.
- exit
- cd
- alias
- env
- setenv
- unsetenv
