# Simple Shell

The idea behind this project, is to implement a shell with basic features.

The project was designed and developed in **C**.

To compile the project
```sh
	gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh
```
To run the program
```sh
	./hsh
```

The program behaves similarly to ```/bin/sh```.

Some built in functions are defined.
- env
- exit
